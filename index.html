      <h2>Biography</h2>
      <p>
        Steve Jobs (1955-2011) was a visionary entrepreneur and co-founder of
        Apple Inc. His life and work revolutionized the tech industry. Born in
        San Francisco, he dropped out of college but continued his education
        through unconventional means. In 1976, he, along with Steve Wozniak and
        Ronald Wayne, founded Apple in his garage. His innovative leadership led
        to iconic products like the Macintosh, iPod, iPhone, and iPad, reshaping
        how we interact with technology. Jobs was known for his obsessive
        attention to design and detail, emphasizing user experience. His return
        to Apple in 1997 saw the company's remarkable turnaround. He blended
        technology with the arts, creating products that were both functional
        and beautiful. His "Think Different" approach inspired a generation of
        creatives and entrepreneurs. Despite his successes, Jobs faced setbacks
        and controversies, but his persistence and determination remained. He
        passed away in 2011, leaving behind a legacy that continues to influence
        modern technology and design, making him an enduring figure in the world
        of innovation.
